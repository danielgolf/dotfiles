# Daniel's dotfiles

In this repository you will find the dotfiles of my i3 Raspberry setup.

You should be careful not to copy everything into your home directory.
There are many dependencies that need to be installed.
It's better to go through every single file...

If you have any questions or missing something, feel free to send me an email or open an issue.
